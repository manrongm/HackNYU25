# 🏥 Medicine Scheduler  

An intelligent application that helps users manage their medication schedules efficiently, ensuring timely reminders and reducing the chances of missed doses.  

## 🚀 Overview  

Managing medications can be challenging, especially for individuals with complex prescriptions, memory impairments, or busy schedules. **Medicine Scheduler** is designed to simplify medication tracking with an intuitive interface, smart scheduling, and real-time reminders.  

## 🔧 Features  

✅ **Add Medications** – Users can manually enter medicines or receive auto-suggestions for common prescriptions.  
✅ **Set Intake Schedules** – Define medication frequency, time slots, and dosage.  
✅ **Sorted Medication List** – Medications are automatically organized by time for easy tracking.  
✅ **Quick Access Details** – View helpful tips and dosage instructions for each medicine.  
✅ **Automated Reminders** – Notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications to remind users about their medications.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

| Component  | Technology Used  |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js, HTML, CSS  |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js  |
| **Database** | Firebase (Cloud Firestore)  |
| **Styling** | CSS (Modern UI/UX Principles)  |
| **APIs** | Medicine Suggestions API (future integration)  |

## 🏗 How It Works  

1️⃣ **User Adds Medicine** – Users enter medication details manually or choose from suggested medicines.  
2️⃣ **Set Schedule** – Define frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) and specific time slots for each medicine.  
3️⃣ **Dashboard View** – The medicines are displayed in an ordered list sorted by time.  
4️⃣ **Notifications (Upcoming Feature)** – Users receive reminders via their preferred notification method.  

## 🏆 Challenges We Overcame  

🔹 **Dynamic Form Handling** – Managing multiple time input fields dynamically with React state management.  
🔹 **Sorting & Time Scheduling** – Ensuring medicines appear in the correct order based on intake time.  
🔹 **Frontend & Backend Sync** – Establishing smooth API communication between React and Express.js.  
🔹 **Conditional UI Updates** – Handling different user scenarios (manual entry vs. auto-suggestions).  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  

🔜 **Push Notifications & Reminders** – SMS, Email, and Mobile notifications for timely reminders.  
🔜 **User Authentication** – Secure login with medication history tracking.  
🔜 **AI-Based Suggestions** – AI-driven personalized scheduling based on user habits.  
🔜 **Mobile App Support** – Expanding availability to iOS & Android.  
🔜 **Doctor & Caregiver Access** – Enabling doctors or caregivers to monitor medication adherence.
